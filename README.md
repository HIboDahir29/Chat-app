Summary Of the Chat Application

Using 'npm run dev' on the terminal makes the application start. The application is running on 'port 3000'. Once the app is running, the app directs to the join page. At this page, the user requested to fill the information of the room and the username. 

Two or more users can join the same 'room' using the common chatroom name. 

The app covers the simple functionality of chatting, and there is a visible list of users in the chatroom. Web socket is excellent in communicating between the server and client. 

Using a built-in function like emit, io, and broadcast has allowed the app to send and receive the messages. The user can also send location with the consent of the user. There is a notification for users connecting and disconnecting from the chatroom.
